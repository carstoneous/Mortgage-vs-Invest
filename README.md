🧮 The Math Behind It
This tool compares two financial paths:
Path A: Pay Off Early
Make extra mortgage payments
Build home equity faster
Save on interest costs
Invest what's left after the mortgage is paid off
Path B: Invest Instead
Make minimum mortgage payments
Invest the difference each month
Let compound growth work its magic
Balance mortgage debt against investment growth
The winner depends on the spread between your mortgage interest rate and your investment returns.
💡 Key Insights
When investment returns exceed mortgage rates by a significant margin, investing often wins
The longer your time horizon, the more investing tends to outperform
Being debt-free provides non-financial benefits that are harder to quantify
Your personal risk tolerance should influence your decision
