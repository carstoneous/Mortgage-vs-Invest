# Mortgage vs. Investment Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization that explains why it may be better to invest extra cash rather than paying off a low-interest mortgage early. The page walks through a step-by-step comparison of two financial paths.

## Overview

The visualization compares two homeowners with identical mortgages who take different approaches with their extra monthly cash:
- Person A: Uses extra money to pay off their mortgage early
- Person B: Makes minimum mortgage payments and invests the difference

Through interactive charts and examples, the page demonstrates how investing can potentially lead to greater long-term wealth when mortgage interest rates are lower than investment returns.

## Key Features

- Step-by-step scrolling story format
- Interactive charts showing the progression of both scenarios
- Comparison of net worth after 15 years
- Interactive simulation tool allowing users to adjust mortgage rates and investment returns
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Implementation

The project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for content organization
- **CSS3**: Responsive styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: Financial calculations and interactive elements
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library for creating the charts

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Scroll through the page to follow the step-by-step explanation
3. Use the interactive simulation at the end to test different interest rate and investment return scenarios
