## 🧮 The Math Behind It

The tool compares two common financial strategies:

### **Path A: Pay Off Early**
- Make additional mortgage payments
- Build home equity faster
- Save on total interest paid
- Invest only after the mortgage is paid off

### **Path B: Invest Instead**
- Make only minimum mortgage payments
- Invest surplus cash monthly
- Benefit from compounding returns
- Maintain a balance of debt and investment growth

> The better path depends largely on the **spread between your mortgage interest rate and expected investment returns**.
